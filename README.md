# Weekly Challenge #20 - Extravagant Button

**For this challenge, you need to implement a UI button that the opposite of "flat", feel free to use gradients, 3D, animations, fireworks...** There's a big trend in UI design where buttons are flat and almost invisible, for this challenge the idea is to imagine what UIs would look like if we went the complete opposite way and everything was extravagant!
